Make 2D games using the Odin Programming Language! Karl2D is a beginner friendly game creation library. It strives to minimize the number of dependencies, making you feel in control of the technology stack. Using Karl2D you can create desktop games, as well as web games (NO emscripten needed!)

See [karl2d.doc.odin](https://github.com/karl-zylinski/karl2d/blob/master/karl2d.doc.odin) for an API overview.

## Getting started

1. Install the Odin compiler using the instructions on [odin-lang.org](https://odin-lang.org)
2. Create a folder for your game
3. Within your game folder, put the contents of this repository into a subfolder called `karl2d`
4. Within your game folder, create a file called `game.odin` (or `whatever_you_want.odin`) and copy this into it:
```odin
package hello_world

import k2 "karl2d"

main :: proc() {
    k2.init(1280, 720, "Greetings from Karl2D!")

    for k2.update() {
        k2.clear(k2.LIGHT_BLUE)
        k2.draw_text("Hellope!", {50, 50}, 100, k2.DARK_BLUE)
        k2.present()
    }

    k2.shutdown()
}
```
5. Navigate into the your game folder using a command prompt and run your game by writing `odin run .` (note the period!)
6. A simple program that just shows the word "Hellope!" will appear. See the examples below for ideas on what to do next, or read [karl2d.doc.odin](https://github.com/karl-zylinski/karl2d/blob/master/karl2d.doc.odin) for an API overview.
7. Enjoy!
8. If you want to make a web build of your game, continue to the [Making a web build](#making-a-web-build) section below.

## Making a web build

Let's look at how to make your game playable on the web.

Here I assume that you've set your project up like the [Getting started](#getting-started) guide above says. Change the the following code:

```odin
package hello_world

import k2 "karl2d"

main :: proc() {
    k2.init(1280, 720, "Greetings from Karl2D!")

    for k2.update() {
        k2.clear(k2.LIGHT_BLUE)
        k2.draw_text("Hellope!", {50, 50}, 100, k2.DARK_BLUE)
        k2.present()
    }

    k2.shutdown()
}
```
into this:
```odin
package hello_world

import k2 "karl2d"

main :: proc() {
    init()
    for step() {}
    shutdown()
}

init :: proc() {
    k2.init(1280, 720, "Greetings from Karl2D!")
}

step :: proc() -> bool {
    if !k2.update() {
        return false
    }

    k2.clear(k2.LIGHT_BLUE)
    k2.draw_text("Hellope!", {50, 50}, 100, k2.DARK_BLUE)
    k2.present()

    return true
}

shutdown :: proc() {
    k2.shutdown()
}
```

There is still a `main` procedure that is used for desktop builds. The web builds will use the `init` and `step` procedures directly. This is because the web build can't have an "loop" like `for k2.update() {}`. Instead, it will run `step` when the browser wants to redraw its content.

To compile the web build, run the `build_web` tool that is bundled with `karl2d`. Using a command prompt, navigate to your game folder and run (note the double dash and the period! The period is the path to where your game lives, where a single `.` means "current folder")
```
odin run karl2d/build_web -- .
```

The web build will end up in `bin/web`. Run your game by navigating into it and opening `index.html`

>[!WARNING]
>If you open the `index.html` file and see nothing, then there might be an error about "cross site policy" stuff in the browser's console. In that case you can use python to run a local web-server and access the web build through it. Run `python -m http.server` in the `bin/web` folder and then navigate to `https://localhost:8000`.

>[!WARNING]
>On Linux / Mac you may need to install some `lld` package that contains the `wasm-ld` linker. It's included with Odin on Windows.

>[!NOTE]
>To get better in-browser debug symbols, you can add `-debug` when running the `build_web` script:
>`odin run karl2d/build_web -- . -debug`
>Note that it comes after the `--`: That's the flags that get sent on to the `build_web` program! There are also `-o:speed/size` flags to turn on optimization.

### What the `build_web` script does

The `build_web` tool will copy `odin.js` file from `<odin>/core/sys/wasm/js/odin.js` into the `bin/web folder`. It will also copy a HTML index file into that folder.

It will also create a `build/web` folder. That's the package it actually builds. It contains a bit of wrapper code that then calls the `init` and `step` functions of your game. The result of building the wrapper (and your game) is a `main.wasm` file that also ends up in `bin/web`.

### Loading assets on the web

Procedures such as `k2.load_texture_from_file("image.png")` do not work on the web because they depend on there being a file system. Instead you can do `k2.load_texture_from_bytes(#load("image.png"))`. The `#load` call will bake the image into your executable at compile time.

If you want to load using `k2.load_texture_from_file` on desktop and `k2.load_texture_from_bytes` + `#load` on web, then you can create an abstraction.

Desktop version (put in a file with `#+build !js` at the top):
```odin
load_texture :: proc($name: string) -> k2.Texture {
    return k2.load_texture_from_file(name)
}
```

Web version (put in a file with `#+build js` at the top):
```odin
load_texture :: proc($name: string) -> k2.Texture {
    return k2.load_texture_from_bytes(#load(name))
}
```

The `$` in front of the `name` parameter ensures that you're passing a compile-time constant, which makes it possible to use `#load` within the web version.

## Hot reload
Some kind of gameplay code hot reload is planned as part of the library. Currently, there is an experimental implementation of this in a separate repository: https://github.com/karl-zylinski/karl2d-hot-reload-template

## Beta 3

Karl2D is currently in its THIRD BETA period. If you find _any_ issues, then please create an issue here on GitHub!

Beta 3 has these features:
- Rendering of shapes, textures and text with automatic batching
- Audio playback using custom software mixer
- Support for shaders and cameras
- Windows support (D3D11 and OpenGL)
- Mac support (OpenGL)
- Linux support (OpenGL)
- Web support (WebGL, no emscripten needed!)
- Input: Mouse, keyboard, gamepad

## Roadmap

- [Beta 4: Rendering improvements](https://github.com/karl-zylinski/karl2d/milestone/3)
- [Beta 5: Metal backend](https://github.com/karl-zylinski/karl2d/milestone/4)
- [Beta 6: Cross-API shader compiler](https://github.com/karl-zylinski/karl2d/milestone/5)
- 1.0

## Architecture notes

The platform-independent parts and the API lives in `karl2d.odin`. There is a [`karl2d.doc.odin`](https://github.com/karl-zylinski/karl2d/blob/master/karl2d.doc.odin) file that is generated from `karl2d.odin`. It simply strips the bodies of the procedures, creating a nice overview.

`karl2d.odin` in turn uses interfaces for creating abstractions for the platform, rendering and audio. 

The platform abstraction depends on the operating system. I do not use anything like GLFW in order to abstract away window creation and event handling. Less libraries between you and the OS, less trouble when shipping!

The rendering abstraction tells Karl2D how to talk to the GPU. I currently support three rendering APIs: D3D11, OpenGL and WebGL. On some platforms you have multiple choices, for example on Windows you can use both D3D11 and OpenGL (using the compile flag `-define:KARL2D_RENDER_BACKEND=gl/d3d11`). Using GL on windows may be beneficial if you want to share shader code between the desktop and web version (as they use almost the same verions of `glsl`). Some kind of shader-cross-API-compilation is _planned_, but not implemented.

The platform independent code in `karl2d.odin` creates a list of vertices for each batch it needs to render. That's done independently of the rendering backend. The backend is just fed that list, along with information about what shader and such to use.

The audio support in Karl2D is done using a software mixer that is part of `karl2d.odin`. The audio abstraction is small, it takes care of feeding the mixed audio samples into the platform's audio API. I wrote a blog post called [Audio in Karl2D: Software mixing, OS APIs and general design](https://zylinski.se/posts/audio-in-karl2d-software-mixing/) where I describe how the audio system works.

The web builds do not need emscripten, instead I've written a WebGL backend and make use of the official Odin JS runtime.
